 	My child! Oh my how you have grown.
 	<<set_avatar Player>>
	Do I know you?
	<<set_avatar Boatman>>
	I don't expect you to remember me but I know that face anywhere. You look just like your mother.
	<<set_avatar Player>>
	->Wait, who are you?
  	<<set_avatar Boatman>>
  	Me? I'm the elder. I have been guarding this sea ever since you were born, waiting, should you ever need me.
 	->How do you know me?
  	<<set_avatar Boatman>>
  	I know you better than you think. I've been waiting here should you ever need me. Old man guarding the sea.
 	<<set_avatar Player>>
	Why are you guarding this sea? It looks pretty safe.
	<<set_avatar Boatman>>
	From here yes but take a closer look and you will see the monsters that swim in it. To pass you need a boat.
	<<set_avatar Player>>
	->I didn't come all this way to get eaten. Can we use the boat?
		<<set_avatar Boatman>>
		Yes but the monsters have been chewing on it. If you can get me 10 pieces of wood and a crystal I can repair it for you.
	->Monsters? Those exist? Can we use this boat to pass?
		<<set_avatar Boatman>>
		The monsters are very real and they have been chewing at the boat. If you can get 10 pieces of wood and a crystal I can repair it.

	Please hurry up darling. I need 10 pieces of wood and a crystal to fix the boat.

<<set_avatar Boatman>>
You brought wood and crystal. Fanstastic.
<<set_avatar Player>>
Yes and you know I'm starting to feel much better. In fact I now feel like I know you.
When I saw you last I was so young but I remember now. I remember how you used to play with me and hold me. It is you isn't it grandpa.
<<set_avatar Boatman>>
My little angel.
<<set_avatar Player>>
But how can this be, you died.
<<set_avatar Boatman>>
I have always been with you my angel as long as your memory of me lives I keep living.
I'm so proud of the woman that you have become.
<<set_avatar Player>>
But what does this mean? If I leave on this boat, will I ever see you again?
<<set_avatar Boatman>>
I'm afraid not. This is the end of the road.
<<set_avatar Player>>
I don't want to leave you grandpa. I miss you so much. Can't you just come with me onward? We can leave this place together. There is no stopping that.
<<set_avatar Boatman>>
No my dear. Someone has to push this boat onwards and you must keep going.
<<set_avatar Player>>
I feel so sad grandpa, why would I go on? I want to stay with you.
<<set_avatar Boatman>>
Life is for the living sweetheart. Just remember that I will always be with you, every step of the way. Don't you forget it.
<<set_avatar Player>>
I won't forget you grandpa.
