    Good morning. Or evening? I'm not sure. It's nice to see you though. How long has it been? I can't remember.
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    -> Where am I?
    	<<set_avatar Husband>>
    	You're with me now
    -> Who are you?
    	<<set_avatar Husband>>
    	You don't remember me?
    -> Look behind you! A three headed monkey!
    	<<set_avatar Husband>>
    	I won't fall for that!
    -> This is an extra answer
    	<<set_avatar Husband>>
    	What an answer
    I was worried the darkness had swallowed you up whole but here you are, beautiful as ever.
    You look confused? What's wrong? You don't...remember me? This is worse than i thought.
    The darkness is growing stronger inside you, but I see a strong burning fire. Your will hasn't been broken.
    To escape the darkness you have to escape this tower. The darkness thrives in these walls.
    Don't fear, I have never left your side and I won't start now. But I need materials if we aim to get higher.
    Do you see that box of wood behind you? You left it here the last time you tried to escape, before it took you back.
    It's just enough to build the staircase to the next floor. Bring it to me, please.
<<elseif $wood_amount >= 5>>
	Great! You've got just the right amount of wood for me!
	<<take Husband wood 5>>
	I'll just take that from you and build a super nice staircase!
	<<build_stairs GameManager>>
	I'll build now!
<<else>>
    Please bring me wood from the box behind you.
<<endif>>
