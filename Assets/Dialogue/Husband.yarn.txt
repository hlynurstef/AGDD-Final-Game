    Good morning. Or evening? I'm not sure. It's nice to see you though. How long has it been? I can't remember.
    <<set $bool_variable to true>>
    I was worried the darkness had swallowed you up whole but here you are, beautiful as ever.
    <<set $number_variable to 5>>
    You look confused? What's wrong? You don't...remember me? This is worse than i thought.
    The darkness is growing stronger inside you, but I see a strong burning fire. Your will hasn't been broken.
    To escape the darkness you have to escape this tower. The darkness thrives in these walls.
    Don't fear, I have never left your side and I won't start now. But I need materials if we aim to get higher.
    Do you see that box of wood behind you? You left it here the last time you tried to escape, before it took you back.
    It's just enough to build the staircase to the next floor. Bring it to me, please.
<<else>>
    Please bring me wood from the box behind you.
