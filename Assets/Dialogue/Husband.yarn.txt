    Finally, you're back! I thought the worst had happened.
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    What are you talking about?
    <<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
    What am I talking about? You don't remember me? Oh boy this isn't good. The darkness is growing stronger inside you.
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    ->HOLD UP! Darkness? Inside me?
    ->...
    <<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
    The more time you spend here the more the darkness grows.
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    ->So I'm becoming weaker? I'm not dying here!
    ->So i'm being consumed by darkness...and you're smiling.
      <<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
      If you lose hope you lose the battle, you taught me that.
      <<set_avatar Player>>
      ->So I'm becoming weaker? I'm not dying here!
    <<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
    No you're not! I won't lose you so we have to keep going.
    Do you see that box of wood behind me?  It's just enough to build the staircase to the next floor. Bring it to me, please.
<<elseif $husband_done is true>>
	I've done all I can for now. There's no time to lose you have to keep going.
	<<set_avatar Player>>
	->It doesn't look like you used any wood to build that staircase...
		<<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
		Looks can be deceiving
	->Goodbye
		<<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
		Good luck love
<<else>>
    Did you grab the wood from the box?
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    ->Yes
    	<<if $wood_amount >= 5>>
			<<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
			Good, give it to me so I can build the staircase to the next floor.
			<<take EntranceHusband wood 5>>
			<<build_stairs GameManager>>
			Watch out!
			<<set $husband_done to true>>
		<<else>>
			<<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
			Thank y... There's no wood?
		<<endif>>
    ->No
    	<<set_avatar EntranceHusband>>
    	Please bring me the wood from the box

  I'm afraid I used up all of the wood building that staircase and we're not nearly at the top.
  I will need 10 more wood to build an elevator for you.
  Take a look around and see if you find anything.
<<elseif $wood_amount >= 10>>
  <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
  You got more wood, fantastic. We should keep going then.
  <<set $husband_done to false>>
  <<set_avatar Player>>
  ->Let's keep going, I feel like I'm getting weaker.
  ->Wait I have some questions for you, do you mind?
    <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
    We don't have much time but alright go ahead.
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    ->Who are you and why are you helping?
      <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
      I just feel this purpose of helping you, I can't really explain it but you know when you've found your purpose? That's how I feel.
    ->Do you know the woodsman?
      <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
      Yeah he's been around for as long as I can remember, old Jack.
    ->Do you know the blacksmith?
      <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
      Blacksmith? She really likes puzzles. She and the woodsman really like each other.
    ->How long have we been doing this? From the beginning I mean.
      <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
      I'm not sure. Time moves strangely in here.
    <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
    Wait a minute, the elevator is not working and I swear their was a lever here somewhere but I haven't been able to find it.
    You need to look around for it.
<<else>>
  <<set_avatar ForestHusband>>
  Let's keep going.

  This place doesn't want us to leave as you can see this lever is broken. You need to find someone to fix it, I'm afraid.
<<elseif $sister_done is true>>
  <<set_avatar LeverHusband>>
  I can't believe you've come this far. You're looking better and better, just like old times. You must reach the end and finish this everlasting nightmare. We've been alone for so long. This is...
  <<set_avatar Player>>
  ->Hey, you taught me to stay strong! Now you have to do the same, we're ending this!
    <<set_avatar LeverHusband>>
    You're right. Let's leave this place.
  ->No whining allowed! I just left a little girl who thought she was a queen so don't you go all crazy on me as well.
    <<set_avatar LeverHusband>>
    You're right, stay strong. But she really is something that little girl, isn't she.
  ->Sssh...there is no try, only do.
    <<set_avatar LeverHusband>>
    Did you just quote Yoda? Anyways, let's go.
<<else>>
  <<set_avatar LeverHusband>>
  We need to hurry up, darling.
