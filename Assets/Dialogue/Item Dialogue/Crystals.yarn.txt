    I could mine some of these crystals with my pickaxe
    ->Mine the crystals
        <<break Crystal>>
        <<mine Crystal>>
        I managed to mine some crystals but my pickaxe broke in the process!
    ->Leave
<<else>>
    These crystals look beautiful, it's a shame I don't have the right tool to mine them.
