    I could mine some of these crystals with my pickaxe
    ->Mine the crystals
        <<mine Crystals>>
        <<break Crystals Diamond 1>>
        I managed to mine one crystal but my pickaxe broke in the process!
    ->Leave
<<else>>
    These crystals look beautiful, it's a shame I don't have the right tool to mine them.
