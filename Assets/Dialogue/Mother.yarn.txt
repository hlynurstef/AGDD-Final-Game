    Is that a broken axe you have in yer hands there? Well let me tell ya repair ain't cheap around here.
    Well I'll be damned, thats Betty.
    <<set_avatar Player>>
    Yes it's the woodsman's axe.
    <<set_avatar Blacksmith>>
    That old bugger must have been too sorry for himself to have brought it over. I'll tell ya what, lets make a deal.
    Don't ya worry I ain't some demon.
    When I traveled the lands in me youth I used to ask people some questions from my favorite movie, to get the feel for them you know? If they knew them answers I knew they were alright.
    So if yo answer all me question correctly I'll fix the axe. Deal?
