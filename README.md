# AGDD Final Game

## Design Goals

We wanted to create an atmospheric story for this one. We wanted the player to feel a sense of dread 
as he explores our game. The game should provoke a strong feeling of curiosity and will to discover what is really happening 
in this story. 

Another one of our design goals was to periodically lighten the mood with references to old movies and/or video games.

We really wanted the game to be non-violent, and for the player to solve problems without violence.
